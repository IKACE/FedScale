# Configuration file of reinforcement learning training experiment

# ========== Container configuration ========== 
# whether to use container deployment
use_container: True

# containers need port-mapping to communicate with host machine
ports: [20030, 20030, 20031, 20031]

# containers need a Docker network to communicate with each other
# Create a network by: docker network create --driver=overlay --attachable fedscale-net
container_network: fedscale-net

# containers need a data-path mount to facilitate dataset reuse
# We assume the same data-path is used on all host machines
# data_path: $FEDSCALE_HOME/benchmark
data_path: /users/yilegu/benchmark

# ========== Cluster configuration ========== 
# ip address of the parameter server (need 1 GPU process)
ps_ip: 10.0.0.2

# ip address of each worker:# of available gpus process on each gpu in this node
# Note that if we collocate ps and worker on same GPU, then we need to decrease this number of available processes on that GPU by 1
# E.g., master node has 4 available processes, then 1 for the ps, and worker should be set to: worker:3
worker_ips:  # worker_ip: [(# processes on gpu) for gpu in available_gpus]
